		<h3>Sample</h3>

		<h5>Toby's POV</h5>
		<p>Toby didn’t know why he thought he could outrun the police. His legs burned but he wouldn't give in. He had to resist or his plan wouldn’t work. It wasn’t the police he was scared of. 


<p>When the policeman knocked Toby to the ground, he couldn’t help but grin a little. The policeman took the stolen item and hoisted him to his feet. Toby’s side grin faded when the cop pushed him toward, not a police car, but his social worker’s car. “Congratulations, your crime has been pardoned,” the policeman murmured. 

<p>Shaniece sat on the hood with her arms folded. She smiled at him with full lips and she squirted her dark eyes against the blazing sun. “Get in, your bags are in the trunk.”

<p>Toby didn’t say anything while Shaniece explained how his plan to escape didn’t work. “It’s only for a few months until you turn eighteen, you don’t really want to spend twice as long in juvenile detention. This time will be better, I promise.” </p>
	<h6>Adora's POV</h6>
<p>Adora was silent as her parents led her to the car. Flakes of white settled on her crimson dress. She pulled her white furs closer to her stinging face. She jumped when her mother slammed the door. Her father clenched the steering wheel. Beau fidgeted with his snug suite and hair. 

<p>"I will take my vengeance." Her mother announced.
	
<p>"It's only a concert, dear" Her father sighed heavily. 
	
<p> "It's not fair to poor Adorabella," She thrust her fist down on the dashboard, causing ice to fly into the car roof. "Evelyn only got that part because her sleazy mother is head of the school." 
	
<p>“Don’t freeze the car dear, you’ll break it again.”</p>
