<h3>Lorena's POV</h3>
		<p>The wind whips my hair and causes my dress to cling to my skin as my hands graze the soft sand particles to create a simple word, humanity. The word that has me questioning my very existence. The wind whips my hair and causes my dress to cling to my skin as my hands graze the soft sand particles to create a simple word, humanity. The word that has me questioning my very existence. 

<p>The crash of waves far out from the shore and the call of the seagulls far above my head stops my humming. I pull my eyes away from the task of forming the new word into something tangible and look out at the deep blue sea growing deeper as the sun descends below the horizon. When my ears catch the roaring of sailors rolling over the waves, that’s when I know mama will be expecting me for dinner. 

<p>I scratch out the letters with fingers shaped like claws and straighten from my crouch. I turn and race up the rocky cliff after dusting the sand off my dress. I run past the harbor where the sailors will dock shortly, and onto the cobbled streets of Lockbund. Houses and shops clustered together tower over me with a gloomy arrogance. I turn into the alley just before our family’s sign, Alvarado’s Stitchery, and clog up the metal steps leading into our home. 

<p>	I’m hit with the warm aroma of salt and fish when I open the door. My feet take me to the open seat at the dining room table, across from my older brother, Lorenzo. Once I sit down, I realize that my family dinner was dead silent. I look up from my stew and into the black eyes of a stranger.
		
<p>My heart pounds as I glance at papa, who stares at me with a set jaw. My guts twist inside my belly when the stranger offers me a toothy grin. “You hadn’t mentioned you had a daughter...” He said, glancing at papa. </p>
<h4>Ronan's POV</h4>
		<p>There were thousands of people below me. I sat in the booth overlooking the stage and waited for the curtains to draw back. The end of my dagger scraped softly as I picked dried blood from my fingernails. The silver metal flashed from the candle light. Inside the dagger was the outline of my jaw. I lifted it slightly to reveal the bit of skin still stuck to my fang. I twisted the black handle and proceeded to pick at my teeth. Today was my 1000’s birthday. There was no better way to spend it than alone at the opera house.</p>

<p>When I sheathed my father’s gift, I examined the carving more closely. Hmph. An exact replica of my horse. My father will have a word about that. I never let anyone near my horse. Besides Vincent. 
	
<p>The vermilion curtains were pulled back and the stage lit up. The orchestra sounded on a beat and the characters came to life. “This is no place for a witch,” was the first line.</p>
